# Minions AI 
_ My First React Native App built with Expo_

Minions AI, an IOS, Android mobile application, that I created during a 4-day solo project, using React Native, Expo, JavaScript, and React. It is a simple and fun artificial intelligence mobile application that tests kids’ basic knowledge. 

Testing is an important part of learning, however, traditional paper and pen testing can be boring and stressful for kids, and possibly not the best indicator of the students’ potential. In this application, I incorporated some fun Minions elements where kids can ask Minions questions and received a response, vice versa, Minions can ask kids questions to see if they are smart enough to be their next master. The testing component is integrated with neural network-based Brain.js library and the training data was normalized with natural npm package. 

## Setup
Note: testing this app requires expo and an iOS simulator/iOS product. 

* npm install
* npm install expo-cli
* expo start
